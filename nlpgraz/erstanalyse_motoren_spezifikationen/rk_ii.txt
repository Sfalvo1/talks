RKII Series 5-Phase Stepper Motors 

1.65 in. (42 mm) RKII Series 5-Phase Stepper Motors (AC Input)






The RKII Series Stepper Motors are designed to provide high performance and energy savings






To achieve constant maximum torque output with lower heat generation and save energy, the motor losses have been substantially reduced allowing them to be operated for longer hours at high speed which is not possible with conventional stepper motors. 














For use with RKII Series AC Input Drivers.
